# Anne Blumenthal

I am a sociologically informed macro social worker who seeks to understand structural drivers of child-well being, with a particular focus on child neglect. In spring 2023, I will graduate from the joint doctoral program in Social Work and Sociology at the University of Michigan. My research and teaching interests include policy and
program analysis, the dynamics of poverty and inequality, child welfare, child well-being and the social
construction of childhood, as well as quantitative, qualitative, and historical research methods. I am also
interested in how macro social work research is communicated to a broader audience of policymakers
and practitioners. My work on these topics has been published in _Child Welfare_, _Children and Youth
Services Review_, _Child Indicators Research_, and _Journal of Teaching in Social Work_.
